# Professional README Generator

## Description

This is a command-line application to dynamically generate a high-quality, professional README.md file for a project from a user's input. The application prompts the user to answer a series of questions to provide information (i.e. email address, project name, description, etc.). This information is then used to generate a README.md file and fill in sections of a template. This project uses the Inquirer package.

This project was built to help other developers quickly create a high-quality README for any of their projects so that they can spend more time actually working on the project. By working on this project, I learned how to use Node.js and the Inquirer package as well as receive user input from the command-line.
